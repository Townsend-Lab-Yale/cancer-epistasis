* Requirements

A local installation of python is required.

If you would like to generate results for the mutation rates you also
require R and the libcurl4-openssl-dev library.

* Instructions

** Dependencies

To install all python dependencies run:

#+begin_src shell
  cd code
  ./setup.sh
#+end_src

We provide the mutation rate results obtained from cancereffectsizeR,
but if you want to generate those results run:

#+begin_src shell
  Rscript ./ces_installation.R
#+end_src

** Generating results and figures

If you want to generate the mutation rates for each of the four genes
(they can also be imported directly in python), run:
#+begin_src shell
  Rscript ./generate_mutation_rates.R
#+end_src

The main method to produce all the results is:
#+begin_src shell
  python main.py
#+end_src
